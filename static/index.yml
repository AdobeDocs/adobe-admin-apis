    # Overview
    The Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API provides programmatic access to constructs designed to support asset
    management and team collaboration. Each construct serves a unique purpose, providing users with tailored
    environments for storing assets, organizing workflows, and achieving specific outcomes.

    ## Project
    A project is a durable space that enables teams to organize and collaborate on cloud-based documents and related
    content. It is a structured location containing related assets, specifically organized to achieve well-defined
    objectives within a set timeframe, helping teams stay focused on deliverables.
    Projects can contain both files and folders.

    ## Folder
    A folder is a container for organizing and storing content. You can use folders to store files or nest them together
    to create a folder hierarchy to keep your assets organized. Folders can contain files as well as other folders.

    ## File
    Files are used to store content in Adobe cloud storage. Files come in three types:
    - **[Cloud documents:](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/about-cloud-documents.html)** These are
    cloud-native files optimized for web applications. You can open and edit them in compatible apps such as Adobe
    Express, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Fresco, Adobe Aero, and Adobe XD.
    - **[Brands and Libraries:](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/libraries.html)** These collections consist
    of reusable assets and guidelines for content reuse across documents.
    - **Regular binary files:** These include standard file types used with Adobe applications, such as JPEG, PNG, and
    MP4 files.

    Although most operations within the Cloud Storage and Collaboration API apply uniformly across all file types,
    certain differences exist:
    - Cloud documents cannot be downloaded as they are cloud constructs. Use the
    [image renditions](#/operation/getFileImageRendition) function to get a flat file representation of a cloud document
    asset.
    - Brands and Libraries cannot be downloaded or used to generate a rendition, as these are container objects.

        [FIQL-based](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00) filter string  

        Following fields are supported for filtering:
          - `view`: Filters the results to only a specific view. The possible values are `yours`, `all`, `shared_with_you`,
           `discoverable`.
             Here is how each view works:
             - `Yours`:
                - Projects in the calling user's User Home storage
                - Projects in the calling user's Org's ESM shared storage for which the user has **write access** through
                 membership in the _everybody group.
             - `Shared with you`:
                - Projects in other user's User Home storage for which the calling user has permissions
                - Projects in other Org's ESM shared storage for which the calling user has permissions
             - `All`:
                - Combination of Projects returned from `Yours` and `Shared with you`
            - `Discoverable`:
               - Projects returned from `All` view
               - Projects in the calling user's Org's ESM shared storage for which the user has **read access** through
                membership in the _everybody group.

        The request will succeed only if the resource's current ETag does **not** match any of the provided values.
