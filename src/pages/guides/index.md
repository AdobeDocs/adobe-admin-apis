# Overview

Adobe storage for business provides enterprise organisations with a centralised platform to store digital assets and collaborate seamlessly across various Adobe applications, from any device or location. The Adobe Admin APIs for Storage Management provide all Enterprise customers with free, programmatic access to a standard set of storage management capabilities to manage content stored in Adobe storage for business, enabling integration of Adobe's storage management capabilities into their workflows, scripts, and tools.

With content retention policy for inactive users, you can:

- Create and apply retention policies for your organisation's inactive users' assets stored in Adobe storage for business, automatically triggering permanent deletion of user assets upon policy expiry.
- Enforce retroactive policies on previously deactivated accounts.
- Modify policies to extend, shorten, or immediately expire retention periods.

This documentation will assist you in:

- Setting up your development project in Adobe Developer Console
- Obtaining and authenticating your credentials
- Automating storage management workflows using the Adobe Admin APIs for Storage Management
