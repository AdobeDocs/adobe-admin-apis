# API reference

The Adobe Admin APIs provide all Enterprise customers with free, programmatic access to a standard set of administrative capabilitiesâ€”regardless of their product mix. Using the Adobe Admin APIs, you can automate the Adobe Admin Console by integrating Adobe Admin APIs into your workflows, scripts, and tools.

## Connecting to the Adobe Admin API

Before using the Adobe Admin APIs, you must create a development project in the **Adobe Developer Console**. This integration registers your application as a client of the Adobe Admin APIs, and provides the credentials required to authorize API calls.

- For setup instructions, refer to [Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/).  
- For information about client credential authentication and retrieving **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, **Scopes**, or access tokens, refer to  [Authentication Setup](https://dummy-link.com/authentication-setup).

## Adobe Admin API Calls

Adobe Admin APIs provide enterprise organizations with programmatic control over administrative tasks in the **Adobe Admin Console**, enabling them to integrate Adobe's administrative capabilities into their workflows, scripts, and tools to automate administrative processes. With these APIs, you can configure and manage a **Content Retention Policy** for your organisation's inactive users' assets and more.

For more information on administrative capabilities available, see [Administrative Capabilities](https://dummy-link.com/capabilities).

All API requests should be directed to the Adobe Admin API server:
