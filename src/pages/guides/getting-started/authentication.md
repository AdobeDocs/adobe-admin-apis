# Authentication setup

Learn how to authenticate requests to the Adobe Admin APIs.

## Overview

Every request made to Adobe Admin APIs must include an encrypted access token. Your secure, server-side application retrieves an access token by making a request to the [Adobe Identity Management System (IMS)](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/trust-center/ungated/whitepapers/corporate/adobe-identity-management-services-security-overview.pdf), using your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you have worked with your organization's **Administrator** and have the following:

- A user account with a **Developer** role authorized for an Adobe product that uses **Enterprise Storage**. This grants access to the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/).
- An [Adobe Developer Console project](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-empty/) configured with either **OAuth server-to-server** or **OAuth user authentication** credentials for the Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration APIs.
- Access to your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the **Adobe Developer Console** project. Securely store these credentials and never expose them in client-side or public code.

For more information about setting up an Adobe Developer Console project, see [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/).

## Authentication Types

The Adobe Admin APIs support Server-to-Server authentication using OAuth Server-to-Server credentials. This authentication method is designed for different use cases, depending on whether your application acts independently or on behalf of a user.

For a detailed comparison and implementation guidance, refer to [Adobe Developer Authentication Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/).

### Server-to-Server Authentication

Use **Server-to-Server authentication** if your application needs to execute actions on Adobe cloud storage content without involving a user.

#### Retrieve a Server-to-Server access token

Perform the following steps:

1. Open a secure terminal and export your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** as environment variables:

    ```sh
    export ADOBE_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID=yourClientIdAsdf123
    export ADOBE_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET=yourClientSecretAsdf123
    ```

2. Run the following command to generate an access token:

    ```sh
    curl --location 'https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/token/v3' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      --data-urlencode "client_id=$ADOBE_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID" \
      --data-urlencode "client_secret=$ADOBE_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET" \
      --data-urlencode 'scope=openid, AdobeID, creative_sdk, adobe_admin_api'
    ```

   A sample response is as follows:

   ```json
   {
    "access_token": "yourAccessTokenAsdf123",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 86399
   }
   ```

   The `expires_in` field indicates the tokenâ€™s validity in seconds, typically, 24 hours. Your application should securely store the token and refresh it before expiration.

3. Export your access token as an environment variable:

    ```sh
    export ADOBE_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=yourAccessTokenAsdf123
    ```

## Technical Account Permissions

When using **OAuth Server-to-Server authentication**, all API requests are executed through a **Technical Account**. This account is automatically created when you configure **Server-to-Server authentication** in your **Adobe Developer Console** project.

However, to enable access to Adobe cloud storage content, you must explicitly grant permissions to the **Technical Account**.

Granting permissions to the **Technical Account** is done through the **Adobe Admin Console**.

> **Note:** You must be an **Administrator** for your organization to grant permissions to the **Technical Account**.

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Technical Account setup guide](#).
