# Best practices for Adobe Admin APIs

The Adobe Admin APIs provide powerful functionality for developers to integrate Adobe's Administrative capabilities into their workflows, scripts, and tools. To ensure efficient and effective use of the APIs, it is important to follow best practices. This document outlines key recommendations for using the Adobe Admin APIs.

## Authentication and client credentials

- Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 to ensure secure access to API resources.
- Access tokens are valid for 24 hours. Implement a mechanism to refresh tokens before they expire to maintain uninterrupted access.
- Keep client credentials secure. Never expose the Client ID, Client Secret, scopes, or access tokens in client-side code.
- Rotate your credential secrets regularly to enhance your application's security posture.
- Only request the scopes necessary for your application's functionality to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Note that the available IMS Scopes are subject to change and should be verified periodically.

## API requests

- Always use HTTPS to safeguard data privacy and ensure secure communication.
- Refer to the [API documentation](../../api/index.md) for correct endpoint usage and parameter formatting.
- Handle rate limiting by implementing exponential backoff and retry mechanisms.

## Security

- Validate user input to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Regularly update API client libraries and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and logging

- Implement logging to track API usage, errors, and performance metrics.
- Continuously monitor API usage and performance to identify and address issues proactively.
