# Roles and permissions

Adobe Admin APIs for Storage Management include an access control system that ensures only authorized administrators can perform  storage management tasks automated through the APIs. Access to configure and manage the Content Retention Policy for Inactive Users' assets stored in Adobe Cloud Storage depends on the permissions granted via a userâ€™s assigned administrative role.

## Assigning roles

The Administrator role can be assigned to users exclusively through the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). Both System Administrators and Storage Administrators roles have full administrative permissions for managing content in Adobe storage for business.
